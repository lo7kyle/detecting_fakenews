Detecting Fake News with Python 
### Abstract
The idea behind this project is to learn how to use the TfidVectorizer with stop words. This is less about understanding how the libarary works.
This is more so to use the libraries to create a cool application to detect fake news and measure the accuracy with Supervised machine learning.
